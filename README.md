# Building Interactive Apps in Python with Streamlit

Developing full stack web applications can be an exhaustive process, with having to manage both frontend and backend development. For python developers frameworks like Django take time to learn and come with many bells and whistles that may not be needed for simple applications. Streamlit is a framework that blends raw python code with a simple API that turns scripts into shareable web apps in minutes, without needed any front end experience. 

This repo has an example application highlighting what you can build with Streamlit. The repo was built for the [2022 Python Web Conf](https://2022.pythonwebconf.com/presentations/building-interactive-apps-in-python-with-streamlit)  
You can view the sample application here: https://share.streamlit.io/banjtheman/pythonwebconf2022/main/pywebconf_st.py
